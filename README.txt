## Overview

ClockMod adds a dynamic in-game clock overlay synchronized with the server.  
The mod allows players to see the current time directly on their screen without needing additional items or GUIs.

By default, the mod displays a simple, clean clock overlay. The clock is updated in real-time according to the server's in-game time, making it perfect for multiplayer servers or solo worlds where knowing the precise time is useful.
